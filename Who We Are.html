                <h3 class="staffSubHeaderTop">Director and Senior Occupational Therapist</h3>
            <p class="staffText">Hello! I’m Monica Malhotra, the Director and Senior Occupational Therapist at Mindful Leaps Therapy. With nearly 15 years of experience in 
                pediatric occupational therapy, I’ve had the privilege of working with children and their families in a variety of settings across Australia and the UK. 
                I graduated from Curtin University in 2010 with a Bachelor of Science in Occupational Therapy and have since dedicated my career to helping children reach their full potential.
                <br><br>
                My journey has taken me from rural communities in Western Australia to child development services in metropolitan regions, and even to the UK, where I worked in schools 
                for autistic children and collaborated with the NHS. Most recently, I worked as a Senior Occupational Therapist at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, where I specialised 
                in chronic pain management. I have also had extensive experience working for NDIS organisations and within the NDIS space.
            </p>
                <h3 class="staffSubHeader">My Approach to Therapy</h3>
            <p class="staffText">At the heart of my practice is a strong belief in empowerment and support. I am committed to neuro-affirming practice, ensuring that my approach respects and 
                embraces neurological diversity. I prioritise creating safe experiences for my clients, which fosters trust and openness during therapy sessions. I stay up to date with the 
                latest research and occupational therapy practices to provide the best possible care for my clients. I regularly seek out learning opportunities to grow as a clinician and 
                continue offering therapy that is evidence-based and innovative.
                <br><br>
                I adopt a holistic approach, considering not only a child’s physical needs but also their emotional well-being, sensory regulation, and overall development. Therapy, in my 
                view, should be both fun and engaging—because when children are having fun, they’re learning and growing at their best.
                <br><br>
                My specific areas of passion include sensory processing and modulation, emotional regulation, and supporting secure attachments. 
                These are the foundations for building resilience and independence in children
            </p>
                <h3 class="staffSubHeader">Outside of Work</h3>
            <p class="staffText">When I’m not working, I love spending quality time with my family and my dog, Leo, who never fails to bring a smile to my face. I’m also a trained yoga 
                instructor, which has deepened my understanding of mindfulness and body awareness—skills I often integrate into my therapy sessions. I enjoy dancing and cooking, 
                and I find that my creative pursuits allow me to connect with my clients in unique ways.
                <br><br>
                At Mindful Leaps Therapy, I am dedicated to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment where every child is given the 
                opportunity to thrive and make meaningful strides toward independence.
